                  "Add freshness and color to your home with the Decorative Artificial Monstera Plant. Also known as Adam's Rib due to the slits featured on its PEVA leaves, a perfect detail that gives it a truly realistic look. It also consists of polyethylene trunks, a high-quality material that is very resistant and durable. This magnificent plant offers various advantages, including the ability not to wilt, so you will have no trouble keeping it looking beautiful. Ideal for your living room, entrance hall, or office, you will create a relaxed and pleasant atmosphere. \n\n We recommend cleaning it with a damp cloth and avoiding the use of chemical products. The plant comes with a black polypropylene pot. Planters that may appear in the image are not included. Due to its flexible material, the dimensions may vary.
